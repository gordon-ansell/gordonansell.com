I support a number of WordPress sites, presumably for sins I've committed in previous lives. I have therefore created this WordPress beginners guide to help my clients.

Why use WordPress? Well, I don't, but there are reasons why you should consider it. There are estimated to be about 1.3 billion websites in the world, and roughly 455 million of those use WordPress. That means about 35% of sites worldwide use WordPress. It has been around since 2003, so it's certainly a mature product, it has plugins for almost anything you can think of, and it has a massive community of users. The internet is full of help about using WordPress.
