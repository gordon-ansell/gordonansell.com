## Pages vs Posts

Before telling you how to create pages and posts, it's worth pointing out the differences between pages and posts. Essentially there is no difference and both are created in a similar manner, but there are conventions that differentiate between the two.

Posts normally belong to a person's dated blog, and they're usually presented in date order with the latest post at the top.

Pages are therefore articles on the blog that have no specific order. They're usually used for things like an 'About' page, a 'Contact' page or maybe a 'Privacy Policy' page.

All this is only convention, though, and you can use pages and posts as you wish. Some WordPress sites are less like blogs (or the blog is only a small part of it) and consist of mainly static pages. Other sites are largely blogs and will consis mainly of posts.
