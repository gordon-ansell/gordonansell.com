To log in to the Wordpress admin area, which is where you create pages and posts, you need to go to:

```https://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/```

[//]: # (@section | wp-hilite)
Wherever you see ***yourdomain.com*** in this documentation, replace it with your own domain name.
[//]: # (@endsection)

You will then see the login page.

Enter your **username** or **email** and enter your **password**. 

If you want to have WordPress remember your details for a while - so you don't have to keep logging in every time - you can tick the *Remember Me* box (although don't do that on a public computer).
