In the summer a 29th thing would be a fan.

I must be using enough electricity to power a Pink Floyd concert.

Imagine all the wires. I’ve just been through a process of trying to apply some order to these things. I think I’ve improved matters but it’s still an unholy mess.

We need to find a better way to transmit electricity.

It would probably be cheaper for me to commission the building of a miniature nuclear power station in the corner of the living room.
