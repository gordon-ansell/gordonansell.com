I tend to agree with [a post by Ben Lovejoy on 9To5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2019/03/26/yesterdays-apple-event/). The announcements from Apple’s March 2019 event failed to excite me too.

For those interested in a summary of what was announced, try [9To5Mac’s Summary](https://9to5mac.com/2019/03/25/apple-event-recap-tv-news-more/).

I can see why Apple feel they have to branch out into services. iPhone sales — their primary earner — have reached saturation point and offsetting a lack of sales with higher prices will only work for so long. 

So Apple are concentrating on things like Apple TV, Apple News, a gaming arcade and even their own credit card. All things they hope will generate repeat income via subscriptions or interest (in the case of their credit card).

But I feel they’re things that anyone with sufficiently deep pockets could do and in many cases have already done. 

Apple’s historic speciality has always been to produce high-quality hardware coupled with high-quality software. Arguably, they do that better than anyone, particularly when it comes to making their devices a pleasure to use.

I’m not sure how they plan to stamp their mark on a bunch of a services such that people choose them rather than similar services from other suppliers.

## TV
Well, as far as I’m concerned there’s plenty televisual choice already. Most of it is rubbish — from boring soaps through tedious reality TV to the dreadful game shows or vote-for-me ‘competitions’ that somehow hit primetime on Saturday evenings — so unless Apple aim to produce genuine quality rather than pandering to the idiot masses like most other channels, I’m not interested.

The [line-ups Apple announced](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2019/03/apple-unveils-apple-tv-plus-the-new-home-for-the-worlds-most-creative-storytellers/) didn’t tickle my fancy too much but I’ll remain open-minded for now.

## News
[Apple announced](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2019/03/apple-launches-apple-news-plus-an-immersive-magazine-and-news-reading-experience/) it is partnering with a number of news and magazine sources — Vogue, Time, the Wall Street Journal and the LA Times amongst others — and plans to offer a subscription to the lot (300+ titles in all) for $9.99 a month.

From a UK perspective the newspapers are all American as far as I can see but even if they devise a UK-specific package I doubt I’d sign up. I get my news from the telly or via free sources on the internet and I just don’t read magazines these days.

## Gaming
Apple is going to release something called [Apple Arcade](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2019/03/apple-introduces-apple-arcade-the-worlds-first-game-subscription-service-for-mobile-desktop-and-the-living-room/), which will allow access to 100+ games on all Apple devices (including TV) for a flat monthly fee.

Much depends on what games are on offer and what the monthly fee is (Apple haven’t said), but I rarely play computer games these days anyway. It would have to include a truly impressive line-up of games to even tempt me and I just can’t see the big names in gaming being part of it.

## Credit Card
Apple will release its own credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs. I believe it does some clever things with Apple Wallet and has no number on it. 

From what I’ve seen so far it has ‘enticements’ such as cash-back offers, but so do many existing credit cards and bank accounts, and an interest rate that only matches most cards on the market. So, meh.

## Conclusion
Sorry for being uninspired by all this but none of it floats my boat.
