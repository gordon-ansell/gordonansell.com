Mark Zuckerberg says:

> I believe we should be working towards a world where people can speak privately and live freely knowing that their information will only be seen by who they want to see it and won’t all stick around forever.   
>   
> If we can help move the world in this direction, I will be proud of the difference we’ve made.  

Hmm, forgive my disbelief from a man whose reputation in areas of privacy is, frankly, terrible and has recently even [exploited two-factor authorisation security as means to invade users’ privacy](https://www.fastcompany.com/90314763/now-facebook-is-allowing-anyone-to-look-you-up-using-your-security-phone-number) via their phone number.

It’s a bit like hearing Hannibal Lector plead he’s strictly a salad man these days.
