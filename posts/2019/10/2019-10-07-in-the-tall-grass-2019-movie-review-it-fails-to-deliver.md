  I watched __In The Tall Grass__ on the weekend and this is my review of that
  film. I thought I’d better write one quickly because it’s the sort of movie I
  could easily forget, and therein lies a big clue about what I thought of the
  film.

  A review of In The Tall Grass, a 2019 horror drama based on a novella by
  Stephen King.
title: In The Tall Grass (2019) movie review — it fails to deliver

leader: >-
  A horror movie with a decent premise, but one that ultimately fails to
  deliver. It lacks many of the key ingredients of a good horror movie, or at
  least fails to apply them after the first 20 minutes.

Without giving away too many spoilers, the premise of _In The Tall Grass_ is that a pregnant woman and her brother are travelling through farmland in the US. They stop briefly and hear a boy shouting for help from within a field of tall grass adjacent to the road, whereupon they decide to try and rescue the boy.

As a starter, that looks promising. It would be possible to get lost a field where the grass is so tall you can’t see over it and it might be claustrophobic surrounded on all sides by the grass. Add in a bit of spookiness from something other-worldly and you’ve got the makings of decent film.

Alas, whilst the starter is tempting, the main course fails to deliver.

The spookiness seems to drain away. There are certainly some unusual goings-on in this field but the movie fails to maintain tension once it gets going. It doesn’t keep up the psychological stress in the way a good horror movie should.

The film is based on a novella by Stephen King and Joe Hill. I don’t know much about Joe Hill, but I’ve read pretty much everything by Stephen King and he knows how to write horror. He is in my opinion one of the best storytellers in the business. He keeps you turning the page even in books where the story itself is perhaps not the best he’s written.

As it happens, I have not read this particular novella but I understand the film is not true to the story. That’s the first mistake and I don’t know why movie companies do that. Why take a story from one of the most successful writers in the world and change it? I can see that certain things may need to be _adapted_ to work a little better on the screen, but a writer — particularly one of King’s stature — will have spent time crafting a good horror and movie companies should remain as true as possible to the original plot.

Either way, I don’t think the problem with this movie is the plot. It’s the delivery. It fails to maintain the pressure and the only reason I watched it to the end was out of curiosity. I watched this with a friend and, if I’m honest, I’d have lost focus well before the halfway point if I’d been on my own.

This film is a Netflix production and having previously watched their _[Bird Box](/bird-box-2018-film-review-worth-watching)_ film I had high hopes for _In The Tall Grass_, but it’s not in the same league.

Maybe that’s just me, though. It’s not _completely_ terrible and it might float your particular boat. If you have Netflix it won’t cost you anything more than your monthly fee to watch this and you might want to give it a try. I couldn’t personally recommend it but it attracts middling reviews from a lot of places and maybe it just didn’t gel with my friend and I.

I can’t see this as anything more than two star film.
