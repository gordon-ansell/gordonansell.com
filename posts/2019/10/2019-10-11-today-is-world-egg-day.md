Eggs are excellent. There are very few meals that cannot be improved with the addition of an egg. To celebrate this day I present you with the _The Order of Eggs_, which are the best ways to enjoy an egg as determined by people.

1. Fried
2. Boiled
3. Poached
4. Scrambled

It is ironic that something as wonderful as an egg should come from something as creepy as a chicken. I am of course aware that other creatures lay eggs but it’s the humble hen’s egg that’s the most satisfying (also as determined by people).

Many US presidents have commented about eggs:

“_The egg is the ultimate creation in nature, I keep one in my hat at all times._” — George Washington.

“_I hope our constitution is like an egg; oval and eggy._” — Abraham Lincoln.

“_Leave my trousers alone and fry me an egg instead, Monica._” — Bill Clinton.

“_What’s an egg?_” — Donald Trump. 

One shocking fact is that _every_ US president has said the word ‘egg’.

Happy _World Egg Day_, everyone. Go on, you know you want one.
