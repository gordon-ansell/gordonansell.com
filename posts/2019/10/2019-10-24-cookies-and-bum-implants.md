## Cookie monsters

I am massively fed up with having to confirm I'll accept cookies all the time. I visit a lot of tech sites and they seem to want confirmation at least weekly. I know by clicking the default _Yes_, _Agree_ or _Confirm_ I'm giving them permission to invade my privacy at will. For all I know they can now legally come to my house and stick their finger up my bottom. They're doing it wrong of course — the cookie stuff, not the finger-up-bottom stuff — they _should_ implement the most restrictive data-sharing settings by default, but that's another matter. I've already given them access to my colorectal system so why do they need to ask again and again and again? And again.

## Staying with bottoms

I read that someone called [Sophie Elise is desperate to get rid of her bum implants](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-50158953 "Read the BBC article."). I know how she feels and I asked my GP the same thing. 

“You don’t have implants,” she said, “you’ve just got a fat arse.”

I shan’t be going there again.
