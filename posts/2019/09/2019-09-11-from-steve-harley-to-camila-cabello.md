I was up with the larks this morning. Actually I was up so early the larks kept telling me to keep the noise down.

I always wake myself up with a cup of Earl Grey and it’s a bit like starting a dodgy outboard motor these days. The pull string needs to be yanked many times before I get properly going, or at least before I start doing anything useful.

I use this start-up time to reflect on the deeper aspects of philosophy: Plato, Descartes, Wittgenstein and of course Steve Harley.

For inexplicable reasons, Steve Harley popped into my head and I started wondering about rock ‘family trees’ and the connections therein. So I set myself a task. 

I don’t really follow the charts because I’m an old codger and music ended in 1985 as far as I’m concerned, but the last I knew about the Top 40 was that Camila Cabello was at Number 1 with _Señorita_ (although I have since found out she no longer is). So I idly wondered if Steve Harley could be connected to Camila Cabello just by using names and bands (i.e. no record labels, places or other, less direct connections … mostly).

Let’s do it, I thought, and before the cock crows. So here goes, and a long and winding road it is (as The Beatles might say).

**Steve Harley** was of course the front man for **Cockney Rebel** and Cockney Rebel’s drummer was **Stuart Elliot**.

Elliot was a session drummer for many famous artists and bands, including Kate Bush, Al Stewart, The Alan Parsons Project, Paul McCartney and, relevant to my current task, **Roger Daltry**.

Daltry worked with **Rick Wakeman** on the soundtrack of Ken Russell’s _Lisztomania_ and of course Wakeman was in **Yes**. 

The cock was beginning to stir now.

In 1980, after the success of _Video Killed The Radio Star_, The Buggles’ duo **Trevor Horn** and Geoff Downes joined the line-up of Yes and, after Yes, Horn became a founding member of the synth-pop band **Art Of Noise**.  During this time Horn and his production team worked on **Malcolm McLaren**’s _Duck Rock_ album.

Tenuous, I hear you say. Gimme a break, it’s 4AM.

McLaren was the manager of **Bow Wow Wow** (and who can forget _C·30 C·60 C·90 Go_). Bow Wow Wow had a short life initially, active only from 1981 to 1983, but they’ve reformed a few times since. During one of those reunions they had an American drummer called **Adrian Young** who was also the drummer for **No Doubt**, perhaps best-known in the UK for their _Don’t Speak_ Number 1 single.

The cock was beginning to warm up its vocal cords, but I was in the home stretch now. 

No Doubt worked with electro-dance band **Major Lazer** on their _Push and Shove_ album and Major Lazer in turn worked on their first single, _Lean On_, with **DJ Snake**.

The fourth single of Mr Snake’s _Encore_ album — _The Half_ — featured **Young Thug** who, with a moniker like that, is undoubtedly a pacifist.

Finally, Mr Thug appeared on _Havana_, **Camila Cabello**’s breakthrough single.

Cock-a-doodle-doo.

A completely pointless exercise but one I enjoyed nevertheless.

Anyway, here are some videos from the start and end of my journey. First up it’s Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel with _Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)_. I like the red coat and bowler hat arrangement, which I should perhaps investigate as resident fashion leader hereabouts.

And now the vastly less good but not entirely bad _Havana_ by Camila Cabello featuring Young Thug.
