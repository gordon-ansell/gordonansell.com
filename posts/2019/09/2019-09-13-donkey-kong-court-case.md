Who would have thought somebody would go to court over Donkey Kong?

It is however true. A video gamer called Billy Mitchell is taking Guinness World Records and something called the Twin Galaxies Scoreboard to court on the basis of defamation after they removed his top score from the records.

The dispute is about whether he used an “_unmodified original DK arcade PCB as per the competitive rules_”. Guinness and Twin Galaxies appear to have some doubts.

Apparently, [Mitchell also has a ‘perfect’ Pac-Man score](https://www.wired.com/2008/07/july-3-1999-gobbling-up-a-record/ "See the article about the perfect Pac-Man score."):

> To achieve the game's maximum score of 3,333,360 points, Mitchell navigated 256 boards (or screens), eating every single dot, blinking energizer blob, flashing blue ghost, and point-loaded fruit, without losing a single life. 

I remember Pac-Man well. One of the first pubs I visited at the tender age of <del>16</del> 18 had a Pac-Man machine, back in the days when you’d get a pint, a chip butty and a number of goes on the Pac-Man for a couple of quid. I played the game regularly and, whilst I can’t remember what the scores were, I can’t recall ever going beyond 20 screens or so, if that. The 256 Mitchell negotiated is quite remarkable.

I played Donkey Kong too, although I have fewer memories about that.
