## The Brexit backstop
Whether you’re a Leaver or a Remainer, the issue of the Brexit backstop is surely puzzling. Neither the UK nor the EU want a hard border in Ireland. Yet for two parties who both want the same thing they’re doing an awful lot of arguing about it.

If neither the UK nor the EU is going to put a hard border up, who is? Is perhaps the Dominican Republic a bit bored with life and threatening to put a hard border in Ireland for a laugh?

## Dwayne Johnson
[Dwayne Johnson tops Forbes highest paid actors list again](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49419053 "Read about this nonsense on the BBC."): ludicrous. The world’s gone mad. Again.
