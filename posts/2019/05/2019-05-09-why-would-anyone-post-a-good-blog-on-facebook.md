Or at least if they do, they should give it _Public_ visibility so it can be linked to from outside of Facebook.

What rattled my cage was a post by Dave Winer on his [Scripting News](http://scripting.com) site, which always worth a read, incidentally.

Dave Winer says:

> You know what pisses me off. A guy writing the best political blog out there, on Facebook. So after I read his piece and think “everyone should see this” I can't send the link outside of Facebook.
> 
> We have this incredible thing called the web and we don't use it.

Quite so.

Yes, I admit I’m not the biggest fan of Zuckerberg and his privacy-busting, pseudo-narcotic corporate silo, but I don’t understand why anyone with anything interesting to say would run their blog on Facebook. 

Newspapers don’t just post on Facebook. The BBC doesn’t. Shops don’t. Even Facebook doesn’t (see their [Newsroom](https://newsroom.fb.com) and [Media Blog](https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog)). Why then should an individual do themselves such a disservice?

Facebook is meant for people who don’t have anything interesting to say to the rest of the world. That’s why it’s shielded behind a virtual barbed-wire fence away from the real web, so that we can keep all those photographs of people’s lunches out of sight.

I could rant on for some considerable time about this subject, but I won’t, just this once.
