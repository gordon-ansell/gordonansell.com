I had to scrabble about a bit to find out how to open Working Copy repositories from iA Writer (on iOS), so I thought I’d document it here.

Basically you need to add it to your *Locations*.

Bring up the *Library* view in the left hand pane of iA Writer and hit the *Edit* button.

Tap the *Add Location...* link.

Then, in the panel that comes up, you should see a *Working Copy* entry. Expand that and select the repository or directory you want to add. Then hit the *Done* button at the top-right of that panel.

If you do not see *Working Copy* as an option then go into your iOS *Files* app, click on the icon with the three dots at the top of the right-hand pane, select *Edit* and move the slider to the right next to *Working Copy*. Then go back to iA Writer and repeat the steps detailed here.

The Working Copy directory will then be added to your *Library* under *Locations*.

You can now add and edit files in that repository as you choose and then, when you’re finished, just go into Working Copy and commit and push the changes.
