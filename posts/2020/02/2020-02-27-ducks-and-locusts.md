The most astonishing thing about the [BBC’s ducks and locusts article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51658145) is that a duck can eat 200 locusts a day. I never would have thought them such greedy guzzlers.

China is going to send 100,000 ducks to counter the plagues of locusts in Pakistan. The ducks may be successful in their task but what will Pakistan do about the plague of ducks they’re then left with? Will China have to send 100,000 cats to cure Pakistan of its plague of ducks? 

It puts me in mind of the old lady who swallowed a fly.
