  The UK government is investigating the idea of building a bridge from Scotland
  to Northern Ireland. Here are my thoughts on this idea.

So, [Boris is looking at the feasibility of a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51443191). Don’t bother, Boris, I can tell you now it’s infeasible. Oh it’s possible from an purely engineering perspective, but so is a bridge across the Atlantic. However it will be too complicated and too expensive. 

When someone first mentioned the idea, it was £3.5 billion. Then when they next mentioned it, it was up to £15-20 billion. By the time they’ve completed their feasibility study it’ll be double that. Then, after a few hundred public consultations, it’ll be pushing £100 billion.

Then of course there’s the matter of the 3.5 km wide, 300 metre deep dyke in the middle of the sea to consider. As if spanning that wouldn’t be tricky enough, we dumped all our unused munitions from WWII in there and, since then, a bunch of waste from our nuclear reactors. That’ll keep the engineers on their toes, assuming said toes don’t fall off due to radiation poisoning.

And don’t forget the workman with the government trowel will be busy with HS2 until about 2310 AD. So if it were to be built at all we’d have to wait a couple of hundred years for it. It’s probably better — and certainly cheaper — just to wait until continental drift moves Ireland close to the mainland and then we can simply jump across.

We must remember we’re not in China, where of course it would be built within a week and would cost about £4.50.
