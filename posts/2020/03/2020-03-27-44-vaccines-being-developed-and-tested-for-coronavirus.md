44 vaccines are currently being developed and tested to see if they will work against coronavirus and *Wired* gives us a nice summary of them. 

Perhaps the most sobering part of it is:

> The Covid-19 pandemic is accelerating the slow, safe vaccine development process, but even the most aggressive predictions don't see us getting protective jabs until next year at the earliest. 

The WHO are running global trials of four of these potential vaccines and some people think *Remdesivir* is the most promising candidate. Remdesivir introduces errors into the virus's replication process and it was originally developed as a treatment for Ebola. 

Rather depressingly, we probably shouldn't pin our hopes on any sort of speedy solution.
