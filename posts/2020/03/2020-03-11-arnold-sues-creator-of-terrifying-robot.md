A Russian company called Promobot created a terrifying Terminator robot that was designed to work in customer services at trade fairs, answering questions and whatnot. It's supposed to mimic human expressions but I think it mimics serious illness much more.

Sorry, the maker of the video I was display here had a sense of humour error and removed it. Take my word for it, it was frightening.

Apparently Mr Schwarzenegger isn't very impressed with his effigy and [plans to sue the creators for $10m](https://www.radiotimes.com/news/film/2020-03-09/arnold-schwarzenegger-robot-sues-company/). 

I'm with Arnie on this one because that robot certainly gives me the willies, although it probably isn't any worse than a lot of the customer services reps we encounter these days.
