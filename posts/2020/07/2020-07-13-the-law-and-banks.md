## The law is an ass

I was reading an [article on the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53385203) about how the government is considering increasing the maximum sentence for assault on emergency workers to two years.

I support the increase but it's still not right.

The maximum sentence for tax evasion is seven years and an unlimited fine. Both are crimes of course, but the respective punishments are the wrong way around. How is it that physically assaulting someone attracts a lesser punishment than diddling the government out of some money?

## Banks stink

Another thing in what's becoming a general day of complaining, I note banks [aren't allowing some people to switch to cheaper mortgages](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53380724).

The problem, it seems, is that whilst they could pass credit checks for an expensive mortgage when they took it out, they can't pass credit checks for a cheaper mortgage now.

That is completely bonkers and something so ludicrous can only be explained by the banks preserving their own interests. Sure, they'll blame something else (like the credit checking rules they follow), but that's just a cop out. 

I quite often get asked in surveys if I think banks have my interests at heart and this just one of the reasons why I always answer no.
