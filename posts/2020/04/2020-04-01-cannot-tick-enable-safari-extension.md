If you find you can't enable an extension in Safari, the fix is simple but ludicrous. I'm talking about the Safari *Preferences -> Extensions* tab where you can tick and untick extensions.

![Safari preferences, extensions dialog.](/assets/images/posts/2020/04/2020-04-01-safari-enable-extension-error.jpg "class=s66 right|@itemprop=image")I disabled the 1Password Safari extension by unticking it and then it just wouldn't allow me to tick it again to enable it. I thought it was a 1Password-specific thing at first but then the same thing happened with Bear Writer's Safari extension.

Bizarrely, the way I fixed it was by simply moving the preferences dialog to the middle of the screen. I never noticed this before Safari 13.1 but it could feasibly have been there. I don't enable or disable extensions all that often and maybe when I have previously done so the dialog has been in the centre of the screen anyway.

It seems to me to be a very odd way to fix a problem and something weird must be going on there.
