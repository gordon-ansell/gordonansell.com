You can now get wheels for your Mac Pro, should you have one. They're clearly made of diced unicorn mixed with tails of mermaid and then forged by Dwarven blacksmiths on the planet of [Nidavellir](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Nidavellir) because [they cost $700](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX572ZM/A/apple-mac-pro-wheels-kit). For four tiny wheels.

Apple are taking the piss, methinks.
