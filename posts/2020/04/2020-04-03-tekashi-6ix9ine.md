Apparently [Tekashi 6ix9ine has been released from prison](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52149538) because he has asthma and is therefore at high risk in any coronavirus scenario.

Fair enough, but the judge said the rapper: "*will no longer present a meaningful danger to the community*".

But what if he starts rapping again?
