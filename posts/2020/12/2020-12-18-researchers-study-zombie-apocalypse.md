Researchers have been studying how to survive the zombie apocalypse. No, really, they have. Shopping malls and pubs aren't a good idea, which means both *Dawn of the Dead* and *Shaun of the Dead* are misleading documentaries.

A team of [statisticians from Cornell University in the US said](https://phys.org/news/2015-02-zombie-outbreak-statistical-mechanics-reveal.html):

> If there is a zombie outbreak, it is usually assumed to affect all areas at the same time, and some months after the outbreak you're left with small pockets of survivors. 
> 
> But in our attempt to model zombies somewhat realistically, it doesn't seem like this is how it would actually go down.
> 
> Given the dynamics of the disease, once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas, the whole outbreak slows down â€” there are fewer humans to bite, so you start creating zombies at a slower rate.

The authors suggest heading for the hills; the Northern Rockies, perhaps. 

Clearly they've aimed their research at saving Americans and I demand the UK government gathers equivalent research for us. They can't leave us at the mercy of zombies.

The authors of the paper go on to say:

> Given the time, we could attempt to add more complicated social dynamics to the simulation, such as allowing people to make a run for it, include plane flights, or have an awareness of the zombie outbreak, etc.

I can't wait.

Whilst I'm suggesting survival techniques, I found this video interesting (and rather more useful that surviving zombies). It's how to survive falling through ice. Props to the presenter for actually demonstrating the techniques twice.
