Hafthor Bjornsson broke Eddie Hall's 500kg deadlift record. He added 1kg to the record, taking it up to 501kg or 1,104lb, which is an astonishing amount of weight.

The 6ft9in, 205kg Icelandic behemoth and Game of Thrones actor won World's Strongest Man in 2018 and also has three second and four third placings in the competition.

He looked like he lifted it fairly comfortably too. I reckon he had 510kg+ in him.
