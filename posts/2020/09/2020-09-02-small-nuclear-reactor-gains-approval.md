A small nuclear reactor made by a company called NuScale has been granted safety approval in the US. It's capable of producing 50 megawatts of electricity and should begin shipping by the mid 2020s.

Alas my hopes were soon dashed. I had visions of being able to order one from Amazon and then unplug myself from the national grid. But when they say it's a *small* nuclear reactor they're speaking relatively. It's 76ft tall and 15ft wide, which I'd struggle to accommodate in my flat. I was hoping for something the size of a desk lamp.

There's also no mention of price, which usually means it'll be expensive. I'm guessing it'll certainly be more than £100 outside of potential Black Friday deals.

There's nothing specific in my flat's lease to prevent me storing enriched uranium on the premises and the reactor has many in-built, automated systems for safety. The chances of me obliterating the South West of the UK would be slim.

This very much sounds like the *enterprise* version of the product, but I hope a *home* version of it is also planned.
