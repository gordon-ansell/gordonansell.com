I read an article about the Marble Arch Mound with both amusement and bemusement. The deputy leader of Westminster City Council stepped down because it cost £6m rather than the £3.3m it was supposed to cost.

I'll stop you right there. Why would any council spend £3.3m on a small hill in the first place? The landscape across the country provides small hills for free.

The council had hoped the mound would: 

> Attract 200,000 ticket holders with millions expected to pass through the area to take a glimpse of the attraction before it is taken down in January 2022.

For this privilege they expected people to pay between £4.50 and £8.00.

One person told the BBC:

> It's a bit weird you have to pay to walk up a hill.

Which sums things up nicely. They eventually let people walk up the hill for free. They said they did that because all the grass started dying, but I expect they didn't get many takers for the entrance fee. Maybe fewer insane people visited London than they expected.

I kept looking for other things that must surely be included with the ticket price. The chance to see a rare bird or a hippopotamus; the answer to life, the universe and everything atop the mound; maybe even just a cup of tea.

Alas no, it really is just a 25 metre mound of earth with some steps up the side.

Westminster City Council are conducting a review to find out what went wrong with the idea. I can at least save them some money there. It's quite obvious. They let a blithering idiot make an insane decision.

One company is enjoying the hill, though. A Dutch architect company called MVRDV was commissioned to design the hill, and they claim:

> Doing nothing was never an option. So when the mound fully reopens in September, I hope that people will come and see it for themselves.
> 
> The mound may delight or divide views and that's OK, but we're confident that in the end it will fulfil its original brief - to get people back into the West End and remind them of why this is a world class city.

It's more likely to remind people of the sort of buffoonery councils get up to.
