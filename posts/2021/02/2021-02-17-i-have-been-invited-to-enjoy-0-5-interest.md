I was astonished to receive an email from my bank inviting me to "enjoy" 0.50% interest via one of their savings accounts. Apparently I could save up to £200 a month for 12 months and then at the end of it I'd be able to "enjoy" a massive £6.50.

It's not that my bank is telling me about this that amuses me, it's that they chose to use the verb "enjoy" as part of their marketing. I feel "accept" or "suffer" would have been better words, perhaps with the addition of "only" or "paltry" in appropriate places.

£6.50 is about a pint and a third at my local pub. You might argue that I'd enjoy that, but I wouldn't. I'd be constantly thinking about how this is all I've gained from sticking away £200 a month for a year.
