At last, Facebook has done something I approve of. They've [banned Australians from seeing the news on their site](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-56109036).

I sympathise with the Aussies who visited Facebook today only to find they could no longer see any news feeds, but this is a good thing in the long run.

Zuckerberg has dragged many innocents into the "Facebook = The Internet" paradigm, touting his closed-shop, misinformation-peddling, privacy-invading platform as the only way to interact online. Australians are now free to get their news from the World Wide Web as they please, rather than from a feed Facebook decides is the news it wants to give to them.

Aussies, if you want a 'feed' delivered to your desktop, just get an RSS reader and add a few news sites to it.
