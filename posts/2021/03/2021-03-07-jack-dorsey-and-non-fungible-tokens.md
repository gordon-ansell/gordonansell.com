Jack Dorsey is selling his first tweet for $2.5m+ and I have to wonder if the world has gone completely mad. Again.

The tweet will remain publicly available once it has been sold to the successful bidder, and this has me wondering why anyone would pay such a sum for it.

But all is well because the successful bidder will also get a *[Non-Fungible Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)* (NFT) to prove they 'own' this publicly available tweet.

> The buyer will receive a certificate, digitally signed and verified by Mr Dorsey, as well as the metadata of the original tweet. The data will include information such as the time the tweet was posted and its text contents.

I'm sure non-fungible tokens are extremely useful in an emergency, which explains why some ~~idiot~~ prospector is keen to fork out millions for it.

I wonder how much money one has to have before a non-fungible token costing millions becomes a desirable purchase.
