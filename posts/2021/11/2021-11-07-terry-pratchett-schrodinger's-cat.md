I quite like Terry Pratchett's take on the Schrodinger's Cat experiment, which, if you remember, suggests that a cat is held in a quantum superposition of being both alive and dead until the box is opened.

In Pratchett's *Lords and Ladies*, Greebo, a one-eyed grey tomcat that appears in a few of his books, is held in a slightly more complicated superposition:

> Greebo had spent an irritating two minutes in that box. Technically, a cat locked in a box may be alive or it may be dead. You never know until you look. In fact, the mere act of opening the box will determine the state of the cat, although in this case there were three determinate states the cat could be in: these being Alive, Dead, and Bloody Furious.
