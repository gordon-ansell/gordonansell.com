I've wondered what Dominic Cummings is trying to achieve with his recent attacks on Downing Street. That's not to say he's wrong, but he's telling us what we already know: the government failed with their Covid response and a lot of the cabinet are useless. It's hardly news to us. So it came over merely as petty revenge from someone who lost his job.

However, thanks to an [article on the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57498845), I can now see what he's after:

> Mr Cummings published the alleged leaks on Substack, an online platform that allows people to charge for newsletters.
> 
> He has said he plans to charge subscribers for insider information on subjects other than the pandemic.

It makes more sense now.
