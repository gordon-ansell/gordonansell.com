> Earth's Black Box will record every step we take towards this catastrophe. Hundreds of data sets, measurements and interactions relating to the health of our planet will be continuously collected and safely stored for future generations.

A good idea. It looks ever more likely we'll be unable to avoid the impending environmental catastrophe.

However, a future generation hoping to learn from this will have to be very different from the generations we've had since civilisation began. Because so far we've just been repeating the same mistakes over and over.

We've been constantly at war and we've still got a lot of countries run by tin-pot dictators. We can't get away from the overwhelming desire to force our own ideological values on others, whether that's one country upon another or a country's leaders upon its people.

Parts of the world live in luxury while other parts of it starve to death. That can't happen if future generations are going to be wiser.

Power and money hold sway everywhere.

I've no idea how we get away from that, but we have to if we want to stop the cycle of repeating the same mistakes.
