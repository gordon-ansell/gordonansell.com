There isn’t a lot of meat on the bones of this story yet but Google said:

> We provide a number of mobile apps in China, such as Google Translate and Files Go, help Chinese developers, and have made significant investments in Chinese companies like JD.com.  
>   
> But we don’t comment on speculation about future plans.  

If this story turns out to be true then it essentially means:

* **2010**: Google shuts down China search engine because they believe in free speech.
* **2016**: Google realises it’s leaving lots of money on the table and CEO Sundar Pichai says “_Google is for everyone - we want to be in China serving Chinese users._”
* **2018**: Google decides financial gain trumps free speech and plans the release of an app conforming to Chinese censorship.

Just a reminder that Google’s 2004 IPO prospectus said:

> Don’t be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served—as shareholders and in all other ways—by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains.  

Hmm. I’m looking forward to seeing how they justify this one (if, indeed, there’s any truth in the story).
