Twitter is transitioning to a new API today. It [announced the changes in April 2018](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2017/building-the-future-of-the-twitter-api-platform.html) but today’s the day it’s supposed to be flipping the switch.

The trouble is, this will cripple some of Twitter’s third-party apps. John Voorhees at MacStories reports the following as being amongst the effects:

> Timeline streaming has been removed, replaced with automatic refreshes every couple of minutes.  
>   
> Retweet, quote tweet, like, and follow notifications are gone.  
>   
> Mention and direct message push notifications have been reworked, which can delay them several minutes.  
>   
> Tweetbot’s Stats and Activity view that displayed aggregate like, retweet, and follower data along with chronological like, mention, reply, and follow information has been removed.  
>   
> The Tweetbot Apple Watch app has been discontinued.  

I’ve never understood why API producers deliberately crock third party apps because a rich developer ecosystem benefits them in 99% of cases. Presumably the people who make the decisions to do these sorts of things have control issues.
