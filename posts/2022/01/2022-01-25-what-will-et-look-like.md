Cosmos asked six scientists and astrobiologists what extraterrestrials might look like. They gave a wide range of opinions, ranging from slime to advanced technologists capable of building Dyson spheres. I like Neil deGrasse Tyson‘s reminder about the Copernican Principle, which cautions against thinking we’re special or unique. Extraterrestrial life is out there, although finding it is another matter.

I’d be disappointed if they don’t have a couple of antennae, a ray gun and speak with an American accent, which is what movies have led me to believe. Or, better still, we find Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon Six, who, [according to Douglas Adams](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Eccentrica_Gallumbits), has erogenous zones that start four miles from her body.
