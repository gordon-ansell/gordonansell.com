*Don't Look Up* is a parody about an extinction-sized comet heading for Earth. It holds up a mirror to the society we've created in the last 20 years or so, a society where saving the world depends on political convenience and is hampered by fake news, conspiracy theories and the rejection of science.

There are parallels with climate change, anti-vaxxers, Trump-era America and the powerful influences of Big Tech and social media.

It boasts a star-studded cast with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence taking the lead roles and they're supported by Meryl Streep, Kate Blanchett, Rob Morgan, Mark Rylance and even Ariana Grande.

I thought Mark Rylance was particularly good as Peter Isherwell, the tech 'genius' who is part Tim Cook and part Mark Zuckerberg. 

All in all, it's a rather good movie. There's an underlying humour that's subtle rather than laugh out loud, and it's engaging throughout. It sometimes looks as if certain things are taken to farcical levels to make a point, but, on reflection, it's probably too close to the truth for comfort. I've thought the world has gone window-licking crazy for a good many years now.

It's worth watching and it's free if you have Netflix.
