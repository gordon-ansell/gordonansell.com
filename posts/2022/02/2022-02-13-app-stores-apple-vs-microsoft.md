Amidst the ongoing furore about Apple's app store policies, Microsoft is taking an alternative approach and promoting itself as the good guy of app stores in the process.

The aforementioned furore has come about because Apple charges a hefty 15-30% of a developer's revenue for using its app store and refuses to permit alternative app stores on iOS. This led to [Epic Games taking Apple to court](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53773715). Epic largely lost that case, but it ignited an app store war that looks set to continue for a while yet.

Dutch regulators recently told Apple it was in breach of its antitrust regulations and must allow alternative payment methods for dating apps. I have no idea why dating apps have been singled out, but [Apple has issued instructions](https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/) to developers of such apps describing how they can use alternative payment methods and still comply with Apple's App Store policies.

These instructions are onerous and that's probably not by accident. So, what sort of reduction is Apple offering to developers who choose to use their own payment processing method?

> Consistent with the ACM’s order, dating apps that are granted an entitlement to link out or use a third-party in-app payment provider will pay Apple a commission on transactions. Apple will charge a 27% commission on the price paid by the user, net of value-added taxes. This is a reduced rate that excludes value related to payment processing and related activities. Developers will be responsible for the collection and remittance of any applicable taxes, such as the Netherlands’ value-added tax (VAT), for sales processed by a third-party payment provider.

A measly 3%! 27% commission instead of 30%. 3% may well be the raw cost of payment processing for Apple, but the entire effort of using their own payment processing is likely to cost much more than that. Developers will be out of pocket even more by using their own payment processing, which I suspect is just what Apple wanted.

Conversely, Microsoft has taken the opposite stance. In a [recent blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/02/09/open-app-store-principles-activision-blizzard/) they wrote:

> **Developer Choice**

I think Microsoft have seen the writing on the wall here and are getting ahead of the game, and they're wooing developers with some good publicity in the process.

Apple seems almost obsessively committed to locking down its iOS app store and preventing alternatives. There are good reasons why they might want to do that, such as the protection it affords consumers [^1], but it's not so good for developers. Apple takes 30% in the first year if the developer makes more than $1 million/year from app store purchases. It then takes 15% of ongoing subscriptions. Developers who make less than $1 million/year from the app store pay 15% at all times. Google does likewise.

Microsoft takes a cut of app store revenue too — up to 12% — but, as detailed above, developers aren't forced to use their app store; they can sideload their app or use a third-party app store and pay nothing to Microsoft. 

I don't think this issue will go away. Apple is using a stick to hang onto its app store revenues and I think it would be better off using a carrot. Allow third-party app stores, extol the virtues of the Apple App Store, apply disclaimers to anything loaded onto iOS from third-party app stores, and match Microsoft's commissions. First and foremost, make developers *want* to choose the Apple App store rather than *not want* to choose an alternative.

I think Microsoft has correctly read the way things are going in this instance.
