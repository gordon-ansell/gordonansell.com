  I've admired Teenage Engineering for a while now and I wish I had a valid
  reason — and big enough bank account — to buy some of their stuff.

  Teenage Engineering have released something called a TX-6. I don't know what
  it does, but I love it.

[Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering) are doing it again. They produce lots of devices that mix sound. I don't need such a device because I haven't a clue how to mix sound — I can barely mix a salad. But they're such good-looking devices that I want them anyway. Their latest is the TX-6, which does many things, I'm sure. I want it on my wall somewhere.

I've been lusting after their Pocket Operator Modular 170 for ages, although I have absolutely no idea what a Pocket Operator is. I want it on my desk and then when people ask me what it is I'd tell them it controls penguins in the Antarctic.

The only thing they have that I might use is a wireless speaker, but (a) I don't need one and (b) it's expensive.

Still, I hope they keep on producing whatever it is they make.
