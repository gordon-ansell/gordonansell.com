## Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe

I'm glad Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has finally been allowed to come home after being deprived of six years of her life as a prisoner in Iran. She was a victim of two dreadful governments: the bunch of kidnappers masquerading as the Iranian government, and the bunch of incompetents masquerading as the British government.

The Iranian government seems to have no qualms about using innocent people as pawns in its negotiations, which is evil, but the British government is equally at fault. The [BBC's article about this](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60819018) states:

> Her release came after the UK government paid a £400m debt to Iran dating back to the 1970s, **although both governments have said the two issues should not be linked**.

They may as well not bother denying it because it has always been about the £400m debt, which everyone knows anyway. That they deny that just makes them look stupid, and it's a reflection on how easily dishonesty comes to politicians. But the thing is, the British government has never denied owing this money — and has owed it since the 1970s — so why didn't they pay it six years ago and get her released then? As she says:

> What's happened now should have happened six years ago. I shouldn't have been in prison for six years.

## Party Politics

I'm astonished this whole [lockdown party situation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60827451) is still chewing up unaccountable hours of the Metropolitan Police's time. Haven't they got anything better to do?

The damage has already been done to the Tory clowns who thought they were above their own rules. They've been exposed. We've heard Boris squirm and no amount of semantics about 'business meetings' is going to wash with the public. As far as I understand it, party-goers in breach of Covid rules might get a £50-£100 fine, but the people involved have very deep troughs and it'll be nothing to them. That would be true even if someone was given a £10k organiser fine. That's pocket change compared to the sort of back-hander they'd get for, say, arranging a PPI deal for their mates. So why bother?

The Met needs to charge itself with wasting police time and get on with more pressing business. You know, solving murders, robberies, rapes, and arresting Simon Cowell.
